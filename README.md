# Find your inner dog
Predict the associated dog type of their proud human owners using convolutional neural nets and transfer learning in PyTorch.

## Context
Classifying dog breeds from images is considered exceptionally challenging, because of minimal inter-class variation between certain dog breeds. This algorithm leverages convolutional neural nets and data augmentation to classify dog images in 133 possible breed classes. 

Using transfer learning, this algorithm achieves stellar accuracy on classifying dog breeds from images. The test accuracy of our model after training for 25 epochs on a GPU instance lies around 85%. This allows us to make an 'educated prediction' on people's 'dog alter ego'. Find your inner dog.

## Starting point
The Jupyter Notebook is available in the repo. This provides you a step-by-step guide to build a Dog Breed Predictor Algorithm:
- Step 0: Import Datasets
- Step 1: Detect Humans
- Step 2: Detect Dogs
- Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Transfer Learning)
- Step 4: Create the Algorithm

*Note*: You can see the output of the Jupyter Notebook directly in GitHub by choosing 'Display the rendered blob'.

## Next steps
There are a couple of ideas for improvements outlined at the end of the notebook â€“ feel encouraged to develop this code even further.
